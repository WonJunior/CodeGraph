##### Codegraph philosophy: code reuse through componentization

Codegraph can work with an existing code base, the objective is not to translate this code into a complete graph. Instead the aim is to rather to create high level components based on this code base. This allows us to use the codebase in the graph to build new components. Codegraph is not a dependency, it should allow anyone to get in and out very easily. Therefore, it needs to be able to compile node graphs into code.
