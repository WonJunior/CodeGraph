**Node based programming editor** to create code with a visual interface.

This is very much a work in progress!

Good progress was made in the first quarter of 2020. However, for the time being the development of CodeGraph is discontinued until further notice. 

Many things, that I wish were here have yet to be implemented... Most of all what I wish for in 2021 is to see this:

##### Codegraph philosophy: code reuse through componentization

Codegraph can work with an existing code base, the objective is not to translate this code into a complete graph. Instead the aim is to rather to create high level components based on this code base. This allows us to use the codebase in the graph to build new components. Codegraph is not a dependency, it should allow anyone to get in and out very easily. Therefore, it needs to be able to compile node graphs into code.
